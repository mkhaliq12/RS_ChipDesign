### SK1
#### L1
Utilization = Area occupuied by netlist / Total area of core\
Aspect Ratio = Height / Width
#### L2
IP: Modules that enclose blocks of logic circuits and can be reused, with IO pins extending from them to interface\
Floorplanning: Arrangement of IPs in a chip.
#### L3
Decoupling capacitors: Cancel noise which occurs due to switching operations.\
Ground bump and Voltage Droop
#### L4
Power Planning: Creation of grid to avoid voltage droop or ground bump.
#### L5
Pin PLacement: Decision on where and how to put IO pins of the chip with the pads.\
Logical Cell Placement: Where to put individual cells of the netlist, with minimal distance between connections.
#### L6
Ran placement\

### SK2
#### L1
Netlist Binding and Initial Place design.\
Gates and Flipflops are switched with equivalent cells from library.
Placement: Positioning of cells on floorplan.
#### L2
Optimization of Placement using estimated wire length and capacitance.\
Wire length is minimized.
#### L3
Placement of Buffers where wires are too long.
