Utilization = Area occupuied by netlist / Total area of core\
Aspect Ratio = Height / Width
#### L2
IP: Modules that enclose blocks of logic circuits and can be reused, with IO pins extending from them to interface\
Floorplanning: Arrangement of IPs in a chip.
#### L3
Decoupling capacitors: Cancel noise which occurs due to switching operations.\
Ground bump and Voltage Droop
#### L4
Power Planning: Creation of grid to avoid voltage droop or ground bump.
#### L5
Pin PLacement: Decision on where and how to put IO pins of the chip with the pads.\
